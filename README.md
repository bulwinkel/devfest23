# Crafting a language partner with Flutter and AI
This is the accompanying repo for my talk at DevFest Brisbane 2023.
Session recording can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFgQ7ma2nQU

## Getting Started

1. Open AI Api Key -> You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Rename the file `main.env.dart.template` to `main.env.dart` and replace the placeholder with your API key.
3. Run the app.

## Notes
The `main` branch has the final result of the talk with the addition of a permissions check.

If you want to follow along with the talk, you can checkout the `take-4-start` branch.

The other branches were from my practice runs, have left for posterity.
